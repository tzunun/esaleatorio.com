# /year/month/day/ or it could be /year/day as in nasa /year/day 0-366 format.
# The page content has to be used to get the text translated,
# It's possible to crete both the english and the spanish version of the page, purpose unkown double effort
# Translation must include the original hyperlink in order to give the option to findout

# Test in AWS
#The latest_story_id has to be saved to a text file containing only the id and nothing else
# IT seems that the issue is the : in the title, this can be avoided by looking at the title line and escaping the special characters or just using
# "" to wrap the title and be done with it
