# Es Aleatorio (esaleatorio.com)
esaleatorio.com is a website build using primarilly AWS technologies.  At its proper implementation.  It obtains news from the site news.ycombinator.com (Hacker News) removes all the clutter from them. Renders mostly text and builds a website that still has the important information from the submitted news.  A link is also provided to the original url of the story in case the script doesn't parse the text correctly.

The result is a text mostly site that renders fast and efficiently regardeless of the device being used to view it. 

The site esaleatorio.com is live.

## List of AWS used in this site
**Route53**: DNS and domain registration.  Hosted zone used to properly point domain and subdomains.

**CloudFront**:  CDN to cache the site closer to the intended audience (Latin America mostly)

**Certificate Manager**:  To obtain an SSl certificate, for the site and possibly subdomains.

**S3**:  Storage bucket to host the static site

**Lightsail**:  VPS running Ubuntu 18.04LTS. PostgreSQL to store the text data.  Server will be running a cron job to start the scripts wich will get the new stories and store them in the PostgreSQL db. Server will push changes to the site repo.

**CodeCommit**:  Git repository (set up ssh-key authentication, somehow ed25519 keys are not supported)

**CodeBuild**:  Build the website, upload the pages to the S3 bucket, and make the CloudFront dispose of the old files.

**IAM**: To manage roles an permissions in the whole process.

## Still in the future
**Lightsail**: Apache Superset linked to the text DB. 

**AWS Machine Learning**:  This is possibly going to be NLP related.

**CodeDeploy**:  To automate the deploy process.

## Other software
**Hugo**: To generate the static site.

# Installation
I used the default Anaconda distribution of Python3. These instructions work as they are in Ubuntu and most other Linux distributions. Windows users would have to select the Anaconda command option from the Windows menu, otherwise it is unlikely to work properly from the command prompt or PowerShell.

The following libraries are needed and in order to install them make sure the appropriate python environment is active and run the following commands:
```shell
pip install html2text
pip install readability-lxml
```
