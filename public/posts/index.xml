Disney Plus will draw upon the brand’s vast reservoir of content, and finally, we know when it will launch: November 12, 2019.
Disney Plus is being priced very aggressively — $6.</description>

Content As we knew, Captain Marvel will be a streaming exclusive on Disney+ from day one, and the company said all of the Cars movies will be there also. Disney also showed off the Falcon &amp;amp; Winter Soldier spinoff show we&amp;rsquo;d heard about, and revealed a new show from Jeff Goldblum produced by National Geographic that&amp;rsquo;s in development. Frozen 2 will be a streaming exclusive by the time it comes home next, and the first one, along with the rest of Disney&amp;rsquo;s Signature movies will be streaming on day one.</description>

GE Aviation is creating adjacent factories in Huntsville, Alabama, to mass- produce silicon carbide (SiC) materials used to manufacture ceramic matrix composite components (CMCs) for jet engines and land-based gas turbines.
For more than 20 years, scientists at GE’s Global Research Centers and GE’s industrial businesses have worked to develop CMCs. In recent years, GE Aviation has made significant strides in advancing CMCs for jet propulsion.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis
Hypothesis that living organisms interact with their surroundings in a self- regulating system

The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the
Earth
&amp;rsquo;s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.
The Gaia hypothesis ( , , ), also known as the Gaia theory or the Gaia principle , proposes that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a synergistic and self-regulating, complex system that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for life on the planet.</description>

If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically- sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing jet. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it by name, I can guarantee that if you&amp;rsquo;ve read many scientific papers, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen jet before. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an appropriately ranty blogpost on the subject:</description>
