#  Overview

##  What is Datawiza Access Broker?

Datawiza Access Broker is a distributed, lightweight, container-based Identity
Aware proxy deployed close to your application via the sidecar or standalone
mode. It provides a unified authentication and authorization layer, decoupled
from application itself. As a container, it can be deployed on-premise and in
the cloud as long as the environment support Docker containers.

##  What can I do with Datawiza Access Broker?

  * Enable SSO (Single Sign On) with Cloud IdP (e.g. Azure AD, Okta) automatically.
  * Enable a fine-grained URL-level access control based on user's attributes and context.
  * Enable remote work with or without a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
  * Manage the access control policy and other configurations via a centralized cloud manage console.
  * Retire legacy IAM (Identity and Access Management) gateways or WAM (Web Access Management) solutions.

##  What are the benefits of Datawiza Access Broker?

  * **Reduce engineering costs**. Developers don't need to 1) write SSO integration code, and 2) implement disparate per-application access control.
  * **Simplify operation and management**. DevOps and admins don't have to manage the access control policies scattered in hybrid, multi-cloud environments, but via a unified console.
  * **Harden application security posture**. Datawiza Access Broker easily puts authentication/authorization in front of all your applications to enable a Zero Trust architecture.

##  How Datawiza Access Broker is different from legacy IAM gateways or WAM
solutions?

  * Legacy IAM gateways or WAM solutions are usually managed by a local Web UI. With the trend of adopting multi-cloud, you have applications on premise, in AWS, GCP, and Azure, then you have to manage/operate your authentication/authorization in each of sub-networks of these environments separately.
  * Legacy IAM gateways or WAM solutions are usually Virtual-Machine (VM) or hard-ware appliance based. They are very difficult to be automated and auto-scaled. With enterprises moving to DevOps, Datawiza's cloud-native container-based solution is much more friendly.

##  Summary

To summarize, Datawiza Access Broker provides a scalable way to enable a Zero
Trust architecture for applications by putting authentication and
authorization in front of apps. It's a solution supporting you both today and
in the future no matter you are working with legacy applications or developing
new micro-services or APIs on premise or in the cloud.
