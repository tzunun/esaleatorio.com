Today I have a few small but interesting updates with a common theme;
expansion

First off, we have **LogicMonitor**. Who announced on May 14 that they had
established a partnership with Blue Turtle Technologies who is one of South
Africaâ€™s biggest IT managed services providers.

I would imagine this will be a win for both companies as LogicMonitor will be
able to establish a stronger footprint in the South African market and Blue
Turtle will have a solid hybrid infrastructure monitoring tool to offer its
customers along side its existing infrastructure services.

Second is **ThousandEyes** , a digital experience monitoring company who
announced on May 18 that they would be putting an increased focus on the
Australian market and have hired three new senior management, one being
technical and two being sales roles.

According to their newsroom, the three new hires have a strong background in
digital experience monitoring and have previously worked at companies such as
Compuware, Dynatrace, and OPNET.

Third, is **Solarwinds** who announced on May 18 that they are partnering with
M.Tech in order to increase the distribution and usage of their IT Operations
Management and Monitoring software in the Chinese market.

I have never heard of M.Tech before but according to their website they were
established in 2002 and primarily service the Chinese and Southeast Asian
markets. This could be a really good strategic move for Solarwinds if they can
leverage the existing relationships M.Tech has with their customer base and
integrate their monitoring and ITOM products.

3 different companies all with a common theme. They say that if you are not
growing you are dying and I think all these of these companies (and their
stakeholders) would agree with that statement.
