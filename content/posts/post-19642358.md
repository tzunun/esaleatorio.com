GE Aviation is creating adjacent factories in Huntsville, Alabama, to mass-
produce silicon carbide (SiC) materials used to manufacture ceramic matrix
composite components (CMCs) for jet engines and land-based gas turbines.  
  
For more than 20 years, scientists at GE’s Global Research Centers and GE’s
industrial businesses have worked to develop CMCs. In recent years, GE
Aviation has made significant strides in advancing CMCs for jet propulsion.
