A team of US and South African researchers has
[published](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02723) highly detailed images of the
largest X-shaped “radio galaxy” ever discovered – PKS 2014-55.

Notably, they’ve helped resolve ongoing confusion about the galaxy’s unusual
shape.

The [spectacular new images](https://www.sarao.ac.za/media-releases/south-
africas-meerkat-solves-mystery-of-x-galaxies/) were taken using the 64-antenna
[MeerKAT](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science-engineering/meerkat/about-meerkat/)
telescope in South Africa, by an international research team led by Bill
Cotton of the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory.

## Zooming in on a cosmic giant

Our research team also took detailed images of galaxy PKS 2014-55 last year,
as part of the [Evolutionary Map of the Universe
project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_Map_of_the_Universe) led
by astrophysicist [Ray Norris](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Ray.Norris/).
We used CSIRO’s [Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Astronomy/ASKAP-and-the-Square-
Kilometre-Array/SKA) (ASKAP) telescope in Western Australia, which just
completed its first set of pilot astronomical surveys.

Thanks to its innovative “radio cameras”, ASKAP can rapidly map very large
areas of the sky to catalogue millions of objects emitting radio waves, from
nearby supernova remnants to distant galaxies.

The prominent X-shape of PKS 2014-55 is made up of two pairs of [giant
lobes](https://blog.galaxyzoo.org/2014/02/03/the-curious-lives-of-radio-
galaxies-part-one/) consisting of hot jets of electrons. These jets spurt
outwards from a [supermassive black
hole](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Supermassive+Black+Hole) at the
galaxy’s heart.

The lobes emit electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves, which can
only be detected by radio telescopes like
[ASKAP](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Facilities/ATNF/ASKAP). Humans can’t
see radio waves. But if we could, from Earth PKS 2014-55 would look about the
same size as the Moon.

## What makes a radio galaxy?

Typically, [radio galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_galaxy) have
only one pair of lobes. One is a “jet” and the other a “counter-jet”.

These jets expand into the surrounding space at nearly the speed of light.
They initially move in a straight line, but twist and bend into many
marvellous shapes as they encounter their surroundings.

Centaurus A, seen below, is an example of a giant elliptical galaxy with two
prominent radio lobes.

Galaxy PKS 2014-55’s [giant
X-shape](https://blog.galaxyzoo.org/2014/02/04/the-curious-lives-of-radio-
galaxies-part-two/), with two pairs of lobes emerging at very different
angles, is highly unusual.

## What makes the lobes?

To understand why having two pairs of lobes is unusual, we first need to
understand what creates the lobes.

Nearly all big galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their centre.

In an active galaxy, powerful jets of charged particles can emerge from the
area around the supermassive black hole. Astronomers believe these are emitted
from near the poles of the black hole, which is why there are two of them, and
they usually point in opposite directions.

When the black hole’s activity stops, the jets stop growing and the material
in them flows back towards the centre. Thus, what we see as one lobe of a
radio galaxy is made up of both a jet spurting out, and the backflow material.

## A mystery solved

In the past, there were two major theories for why PKS 2014-55 has two pairs
of lobes.

The first suggested there were actually _two_ massive active black holes at
the galaxy’s centre, each emitting two [powerful
jets](https://blog.galaxyzoo.org/2014/01/22/how-do-black-holes-form-jets/).

The second theory suggested the supermassive black hole had undergone a [spin
flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-flip). This is when a rotating black
hole’s spin axis has a sudden change in orientation, resulting in a second
pair of jets at a different angle from the first pair.

But the recent observations from the South African MeerKAT telescope strongly
suggest a third possibility: that the two larger lobes are the fast-moving
particles zooming out from the black hole, while the two smaller lobes are the
backflow looping around to fall back in.

The MeerKAT team achieved high-resolution images ten times more sensitive than
our ASKAP pilot observations conducted here in Australia last year.

## A cosmic wonder

Using [CSIRO’s ASKAP](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Facilities/ATNF/ASKAP)
telescope, our team observed the “purple butterfly” of PKS 2014-55 to be an
enormous cosmic structure. It spans at least five million light years – about
20 times the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.

PKS 2014-55 is located on the outskirts of a massive cluster of galaxies known
as Abell 3667. It was discovered more than 60 years ago using the [Mills Cross
Telescope](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/jun02/Flowering_of_Fleurs.htm)
at CSIRO’s old [Fleurs field
station](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?id=2260832)
in New South Wales.

The galaxy’s first detailed radio picture was taken by [Ron
Ekers](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rekers/) in 1969.

## ASKAP

The ASKAP telescope we used to capture PKS 2014-55 is an array of 36 radio
dishes laid out in a pattern six kilometres in diameter. Together, the dishes
make up a large radio telescope that uses Earth’s rotation to produce sharp
images of astronomical sources near and far.

Each dish is 12m wide and
[equipped](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Astronomy/ASKAP-and-the-Square-
Kilometre-Array/PAFs) with new technologies developed by CSIRO and industry
partners. ASKAP is a fast survey machine, taking radio images over very wide
areas of the sky. Several surveys of the entire sky are expected to start next
year.
