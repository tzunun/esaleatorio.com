# Spacecode (Preview)

![Space Code

This extension is inspired by spacemacs and aiming to provide similar
experience in VSCode. An action menu trigger by space key is implemented to
reduce memorization of shortcuts. You can change the editor group, change the
file language, and check git status without leaving your keyboard. This
provides speed to shortcut while minimizing typing comparing to fuzzy search
in the command palette or shortcut memorizing.

## Features

  * Spacemacs like action menu to reduce memorization of shortcuts

## Requirements

  * [VSCode Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) (required for default space key)
  * [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) (required for default bindings)
  * [edmagit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kahole.magit) and its Vim bindings (required for default bindings)

## Customization

> The following instructions might change during preview

#### I don't use VSCode Vim

Since the default key binding adding by this extensions will only tigger when
Vim extension is active, you can just add a new binding in the your own
`keybindings.json`. The following json is an example to bind `alt+space` to
the action menu.

    
    
    {
      "key": "alt+space",
      "command": "spacecode.space",
      "when": "editorTextFocus"
    },
    

#### I use Vim, but I just don't like the `space` key

You will have to remove the key binding added by this extension and replace
that with your own. The following json is example to bind `alt+space` to the
action menu.

    
    
    {
      "command": "-spacecode.space",
      "key": "space",
      "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && !inDebugRepl && vim.mode =~ /^Normal|Visual|VisualBlock|VisualLine$/"
    },
    {
      "command": "spacecode.space",
      "key": "alt+space",
      "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && !inDebugRepl && vim.mode =~ /^Normal|Visual|VisualBlock|VisualLine$/"
    },
    
    

To customize the menu, copy the default `spacecode.bindings` value in
`package.json` in this repo and put the updated `spacecode.bindings` config in
your own `setting.json`.

> The actions are subject to change before `1.0.0`. If you find something you
> think it should bind to a particular key, or you want some particular
> function, please open an issue as a feature request.
