"Elements of Green" by Prowler (Klas Benjaminsson).  
  
Made for the graphics compo at Datastorm 2013 (placed 1:st), and for the demo
"15 years of fame". Sorry it had to be a party-version for the compo - but
time beat me big time this year! You can download the final version here:

Greetings to everyone at the party!  
The idea was to visualize the 3 elements of the forest and make them blend
into the woods seamlessly. The picture didn't really turn out the way I hoped
and the composition went off balance, but it was fun to make it anyways.  
  
Big thanks to Abyssal Plains (Maurizio Giambrone) for letting me use his
amazing tune "Orange River", featured in the album "Hemispherical Sky".
