## GRAND PLAN

# Spotify’s Podcasting Strategy

## Becoming Google for audio.

The podcasting industry is finally reaching escape velocity. New technologies
like AirPods, smart speakers and connected cars have seen substantial growth
in the last 3 years making it easy for consumers to consume content and
incentivizing creators to create high-quality content.

The number of podcast listeners has been growing steadily over the past few
years. As of 2019, **_a quarter of Americans_** have been listening to
podcasts **_weekly_**.

 **The average weekly listener is spending 6+ hours listening to podcasts
weekly**

Apple played an important role in the development of the podcasting industry
and their app remains the most prominent app for listening to podcasts however
their share fell from over 80% to just over 60% in the last few years. The
reduction in market share can be explained by two factors. The first being
that iOS was the predominant platform for listening to podcasts however that
changed when Google launched its own podcasting app in June 2018 and a long
tail of other well-funded companies providing a seamless cross-platform
experience. The second being Spotify and their big push into podcasting in the
last two years.

 **Spotify has gained 10% market share in 4 years**

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote a blog post in 2019, highlighting the company’s
transition from music first to audio first. He states that he expects 20% of
all Spotify listening will be non-music content. He expects podcasts to play
an important role in increasing user engagement, reducing churn and improving
the bottom line. You can read the post

Spotify made a huge push in the podcasting space in 2019 by acquiring [Gimlet
Media](https://gimletmedia.com/) which is a podcast network with shows like
_Reply All_ and _Startup,_ and [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/), a podcast
creation app, for a combined $340 million according to their
[SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639920/000156459019002688/ck0001639920-20f_20181231.htm#ITEM_3_KEY_INFORMATION)
filing. They ended their shopping spree in 2019 by acquiring
[Parcast](https://www.parcast.com/), a podcast network that specializes in
true crime, mystery and science-fiction shows for an undisclosed amount. The
company did not stop there. They acquired [The
Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/) in 2020 reportedly for around $196
million, a media company known both for its culture website and massive
podcast operation headlined by _The Bill Simmons Podcast_. The latest
acquisition is The Joe Rogan Experience.

On May 19, Joe Rogan announced that he signed an exclusive deal to bring his
podcast to Spotify. The exact terms aren’t public, but the consensus seems to
be that Spotify will pay Rogan well over $100 million to license the back
catalog and future episodes of his podcast, [The Joe Rogan
Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joe_Rogan_Experience). Joe Rogan
is considered the most successful podcaster in the world topping almost every
podcast popularity chart except Spotify’s because the show had been absent
from the platform and now by the end of the year it will be exclusively
available on Spotify.

Spotify grew their monthly active users (MAU) by 31%, premium subscribers by
31% and ad-supported MAUs by 32% in the first quarter of 2020 according to
their [financial report](https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-
release-details/2020/Spotify-Technology-SA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-
First-Quarter-2020/default.aspx). Their quarterly results have become easy to
anticipate over the last few quarters.

Growth in MAU over the last 3 years

Strong user growth and retention trend if offset by non-existent profits and
slim margins. For every dollar that the company brings in, only 25 cents is
left to cover the costs of running the business after accounting for music
rights and other costs. After considering the cost of R&D and marketing
required to stay competitive in this market, their path to profitability
looked bleak at best. They are not in a powerful position to negotiate with
record labels because Apple Music provides a perfectly good alternative in the
paid music streaming space.

Spotify realizes that podcasts can help them solve a lot of issues that exist
with their current business model however, the **bigger opportunity for them
is to become podcast aggregators**. The current podcasting landscape is
similar to the early days of the web. Google and Facebook realized that the
best way to advertise was to aggregate users and deliver targeted ads. Spotify
is well pushing to become the aggregator for podcasts and capitalize on their
286 million MAU’s by providing targeted ads which they have refrained from
doing so far. A very small percent of Spotify’s revenue is generated by
advertising.

There’s never been a single podcasting company that sells ads, makes shows,
has an already-popular podcast player, and offers the tools to make new
series. Spotify now has all of that, and they will use it to provide superior
user experience, use data to target ads and provide superior tools for
advertisers.

Two of the main issues with the open podcasting ecosystem is difficult to
discover new podcasts and to gain insights about the listeners. Spotify has a
solution for both these problems thanks to their data science and analytics
investments over the years. The company has created algorithmically generated
[podcast playlists](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-19/your-daily-
podcasts-playlist-makes-finding-your-next-favorite-show-easier-than-ever/) and
launched its own advertising tool called [Streaming Ad
Insertion](https://www.spotifyforbrands.com/en-US/news/sai-announcement).
Spotify could become the go-to for audio advertising just like google and
Facebook have become the go-to destinations for advertising on the web.

The US newspaper industry generated $37.8 billion in [advertising
revenue](https://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/) in 2008 and Google
generated $21.13 billion. In 2019, Google generated $134.81 billion dollars in
[advertising alone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-
revenue-of-google/) while the entire newspaper industry generated 14.8
billion.

The global radio [advertising
industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272947/global-radio-advertising-
expenditure/) is worth $35.23 billion dollars in 2020. Spotify generated $7.5
billion dollars in 2019 out of which only $753 million dollars came from
advertising. Spotify is well-positioned to become the Google for audio and the
upside in doing so is substantial.
