Google partnered with Huawei to create the Nexus 6P.

After [Google](/google/) partnered with [Huawei](/tags/huawei/) to launch the
[Nexus 6P](/reviews/google-nexus-6p-review/) in 2015, many users of the phone
[experienced bootloop issues](/news/why-i-regret-buying-a-google-phone/). Now,
the two companies have preliminary agreed to pay Nexus 6P users who suffered
from this issue in a class-action lawsuit, according to [The
Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306552/google-huawei-
nexus-6p-class-action-lawsuit-settlement-agreement-compensate). The suit first
began on April 2017 and the companies could pay up to $9.75 million in total
pay outs.

When a phone has a bootloop issue, it unexpectedly crashes and reboots itself
continuously, rendering it unworkable. Users who bought a [Nexus
6P](/reviews/google-nexus-6p-review/) on Sept. 25, 2015, and after are
eligible for up to $400 in repayment if they have proper documentation. Other
users who received a [Pixel XL](/reviews/google-pixel-xl-review/) as part of a
[previous warranty exchange
program](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/09/13/google-offering-
nexus-6p-owners-pixel-xl-warranty-replacement/) are eligible for only $10. You
can read more details about the case, including info on how to submit your own
claim [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/405929329/As-Filed-Long-Form-
Notice-in-Google-Huawei-class-action-lawsuit-re-Nexus-6P-bootloop-

This isn't the first time a major phone maker faced a class action lawsuit
over bootloop problems. In March 2017, customers sued [LG](/tags/lg/) for
defective [LG G4](/reviews/lg-g4-review/) and [LG
V10](/reviews/lg-v10-review/). Acknowledging the issue, LG told [Android
Authority](http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-admits-g4-bootloop-problem-
hardware-fault-669603/) in 2016 that it was a result of "loose contact between
components."

Google and Huawei did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
