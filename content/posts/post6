‘Weapon of Mass Destruction’ is a term used in arms-control circles signifying
something capable of damage on a large scale and subject to international
treaties. Analyst Zak Kallenborn argues in a [recent
study](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CSDS/monographs/MONO60%20Drone%20Swarms%20as%20WMD.pdf?ver=2020-05-13-135901-057
"https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CSDS/monographs/MONO60%20Drone%20Swarms%20as%20WMD.pdf?ver=2020-05-13-135901-057")
for the U.S. Air Force Center for Strategic Deterrence Studies that some types
of drone swarm would count as WMD. The argument might seem like the
theoretical arms control equivalent of angels dancing on the head of a pin —
except that the U.S. Army is working on a lethal swarm which fits Kallenborn’s
description.

Skeet submunitions destroy target vehicles in test

U.S. Air Force

Current drones like the [MQ-9 Reaper](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-
Sheets/Display/Article/104470/mq-9-reaper/ "https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-
Sheets/Display/Article/104470/mq-9-reaper/") are controlled remotely, with a
pilot flying the aircraft and a payload operator aiming and launching
missiles. A battery of other personnel, including military lawyers and image
analysts, [look over their shoulders](https://dronewars.net/2017/05/30/justin-
thompson-interview/ "https://dronewars.net/2017/05/30/justin-thompson-
interview/") and argue what is or is not a valid target. (The movie [Eye in
the Sky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2057392/
"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2057392/") brilliantly captured the military-
political-legal wrangling during drone operations). Future drones may have
more autonomy, flying and fighting with much less human supervision, in
particular when many of them work together as a swarm.

Kallenborn, an expert in unmanned systems and WMD, [describes one type of
swarm](https://mwi.usma.edu/swarms-mass-destruction-case-declaring-armed-
fully-autonomous-drone-swarms-wmd/ "https://mwi.usma.edu/swarms-mass-
destruction-case-declaring-armed-fully-autonomous-drone-swarms-wmd/") that he
calls an Armed, Fully-Autonomous Drone Swarm, or AFADS. Once unleashed an
AFADS will locate, identify, and attack targets without human intervention.
Kallenborn argues that an AFADS-type swarm is a genuine Weapon of Mass
Destruction because of the amount of harm it can do and because of its
inability to distinguish civilians from military targets. This is the type of
swarm in the fictional 2017 viral video
[Slaughterbots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA") released as a warning against
autonomous weapons.

Like Terminators, such drones may look like science fiction. But the U.S. Army
has been working on a [Cluster UAS Smart Munition for Missile
Deployment](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1207935
"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1207935") which looks like a real-
world embodiment of AFADS.

The Cluster Swarm project is developing a missile warhead to dispense a swarm
of small drones that fan out to locate and destroy vehicles with explosively
formed penetrators or EFPs. (An EFP [spits a high-speed
slug](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a19053/the-army-want-
some-silver-bullets/
"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a19053/the-army-want-some-
silver-bullets/") of armor-piercing metal some tens or hundreds of meters).
This is similar in concept to the [existing CBU-105
bomb](http://armamentresearch.com/us-cbu-97cbu-105-sensor-fuzed-weapon-
cluster-munition/ "http://armamentresearch.com/us-cbu-97cbu-105-sensor-fuzed-
weapon-cluster-munition/"), a 1000-pound munition which scatters forty ‘Skeet’
submunitions each over the target area, each of which parachutes down,
scanning the ground with a seeker until it finds a tank and fires an EFP at
it; the picture above shows one test. CBU-105’s dropped by B-52 bombers
successfully [knocked out entire Iraqi tank
columns](https://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/08/19/hln.terror.sensor.fuzed/
"https://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/08/19/hln.terror.sensor.fuzed/") in 2003,
leading them to be termed ‘[Cans of whup-
ass.’](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/1081m-for-13280-cans-of-
whupass-01782/ "https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/1081m-for-13280-cans-of-
whupass-01782/") The Cluster Swarm would be vastly more powerful.

The Cluster Swarm involved drones packed into the Army’s existing [GMLRS
rockets](https://www.army-technology.com/projects/mlrs/ "https://www.army-
technology.com/projects/mlrs/"), which carry a 180-pound payload and have a
range of over 70 kilometers, or [ATACMS
missiles](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/atacms/
"https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/atacms/") that carry a 350-pound
payload over 270 kilometers. The original idea was that the missile payload
would be quadcopter drones encased in an aerodynamic shell that would disperse
them over the target area. However, the challenges of unfolding quadcopters
mid-air may have been too great, as the [Phase II
development](https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1624487
"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/1624487"), recently completed, went to
[AVID LLC](http://www.avidaerospace.com/ "http://www.avidaerospace.com/"), who
have a slightly different approach.

T-Hawk ducted-fan tactical drone

U.S. Navy

AVID are best known for their work with Honeywell on the [T-Hawk
drone](https://www.army-technology.com/projects/honeywell-thawk-mav-us-army/
"https://www.army-technology.com/projects/honeywell-thawk-mav-us-army/"), a
tactical vertical take-off craft deployed in Iraq to help find IEDs in 2007.
Affectionately known as the ‘[flying beer
keg](https://www.wired.com/2011/01/last-call-for-armys-flying-beer-keg-drone/
"https://www.wired.com/2011/01/last-call-for-armys-flying-beer-keg-drone/"),’
the T-Hawk has no external rotors but is powered by ducted fans inside the
fuselage. AVID later produced the smaller
[EDF-8](http://www.avidaerospace.com/avid-edf-8
"http://www.avidaerospace.com/avid-edf-8"), an electrically-powered ducted-fan
drone carrying a one-pound payload. The company would not provide comment on
the drones developed for the new project.

The Cluster Swarm would be far more powerful than the existing CBU-105 ‘cans
of whup-ass’ for two reasons. A CBU-105 can only hit targets in an area a few
hundred meters across. The Cluster Swarm can go hunting for vehicles dispersed
over many square miles.

The other advantage is efficiency. CBU-105 gives little overlap in search area
for each warhead; many will not have a target, and where there is overlap two
or more may attack the same tank and ignore others. A true swarm acting co-
operatively will ‘de-conflict’ so forty drones always attack forty different
targets.

If Cluster Swarm drones have EFP warheads similar to existing weapons, then
each MLRS missile would release about ten drones. Each [M270 MLRS
vehicle](https://www.army-technology.com/projects/mlrs/ "https://www.army-
technology.com/projects/mlrs/") fires twelve missiles in a salvo, for a
hundred and twenty drones. So a [battery of nine launch
vehicles](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-60/Ch2.htm
"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/6-60/Ch2.htm")
would deliver a thousand killer drones over the target area, enough in theory
to stop an entire armored division in its tracks.

Would such a swarm constitute a WMD?

“The weapon could plausibly be classified as a weapon of mass destruction,”
Kallenborn said. “However, it would depend on the number and payload of armed
UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles] within the swarm.”

Kallenborn says that as a rough rule of thumb, a swarm with munitions
equivalent to a thousand [M67 hand
grenades](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m67.htm
"https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m67.htm") would likely be in the WMD
class. If it meets this threshold, then according to his new paper the swarm
could be [subject to international arms control
law](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CSDS/monographs/MONO60%20Drone%20Swarms%20as%20WMD.pdf?ver=2020-05-13-135901-057
"https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CSDS/monographs/MONO60%20Drone%20Swarms%20as%20WMD.pdf?ver=2020-05-13-135901-057").

“Certainly off-course drones would have potential for considerable damage if
they identified civilian vehicles as military ones,” says Kallenborn.

It is easy to see how an attack directed at a column of tanks might end up
hitting a nearby refugee convoy with catastrophic results, destroying not just
a few vehicles but dozens of them. This ought to be impossible, and the
Pentagon ‘s [Policy Directive
3000.09](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf
"https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf")
is intended to ‘minimize the probability and consequences of failures in
autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems that could lead to unintended
engagements.’ But in war, mistakes happen.

However, proving whether it is a WMD or not could be difficult. How do you
tell whether you are facing a single WMD-level swarm or a collation of smaller
swarms?

“If swarms are WMD, verification and confidence measures might need to
evaluate whether a set of drones are a single swarm or multiple. Evaluating
whether the swarm is fully autonomous would also be a challenge,” says
Kallenborn.

Even if it is not deemed a WMD, any swarm with this sort of potential raises
issues about how much autonomy is acceptable.

“The weapon illustrates the need to carefully consider what risks the United
States is willing to accept,” says Kallenborn.

The Phase II development completed in March included “deployment…powered
flight, acquisition of a representative target, and automated navigation to
and landing on target” as well as a separate demonstration of the EFP
warhead’s effectiveness. If the Army go ahead with Phase III and integrate the
drones into a missile warhead, deployment could follow soon.

The U.S. is not the only player in this field, and may not even be the leader.
Turkey has already fielded [Kargu tactical kamikaze
drones](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217171-autonomous-killer-drones-
set-to-be-used-by-turkey-in-syria/
"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2217171-autonomous-killer-drones-set-to-
be-used-by-turkey-in-syria/") in small numbers on the Syrian border. Currently
these are piloted remotely, but the makers claim the Kargu has autonomous
swarming capability. China and Russia are not so far behind.

Unlike other WMD, drone swarms can be acquired at low cost and require
relatively little technical skill. If there is a military advantage to be had,
the U.S. may choose to delay discussions about whether their swarms should
count as WMD. The situation may change if others deploy them – and if they
start causing large numbers of casualties.
