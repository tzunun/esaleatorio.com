A leaked version of [the iOS 14
update](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/) has been circulating for a
few months, giving us an idea of what Apple is [working
on](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/09/apple-ios-14-fitness-app-guided-
workouts/) behind the scenes for the new update.

Details about

[iOS 14](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/)

have been

[trickling out](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/)

, and today, Josh Constine (formerly of

_TechCrunch_

) has shared leaked Apple QR codes, details about Apple's work on an AR app,
and sounds for the upcoming Apple Tags in his

[Moving Product newsletter](https://constine.substack.com/p/leaked-pics-from-
apples-ar-app-gobi)

.

Apple appears to be implementing a new QR code format that uses colored cones,
with the files found in the "Gobi" AR app that Apple has been working on.
Constine says QR codes open up [Mac
Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/) and [Apple
Watch](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/) websites, the Star
Wars: Rogue One movie in iTunes, and the Starbucks Card sign-up.

new/2020/05/appleQRcodes.jpg)  
The code also featured references to a Gobi comparison shopping feature that
could be in the AR app, and, in line with previous rumors about a [possible
Starbucks partnership](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/10/ios-14-augmented-
reality-app-gobi/), there were references to Starbucks discounts at specific
locations, which suggests the Gobi app could offer promotions or content
experiences based on location.

A video shared by Constine also features sounds and vibrations that will be
used in the [Find My](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/) app to help
people locate their lost devices. As described by Constine:

> You'll hear encouraging sounds when you face the right direction so the lost
> gadget is "Ahead" of you, when you're "Nearby", or come within "Arms Reach",
> while discouraging tones hint that you're headed off course.
