After high school, Dr. Henry joined the naval reserves, drawn by the
camaraderie, naval navigation and communication techniques, and the lure of
the open ocean. She enlisted in her third year of medical school and graduated
to become a fleet medical officer in Esquimalt, B.C., not far from where she
lives now.

“I look back on it now, a lot of the work I was doing with a group of captive
men was prevention. They would tease me about always telling them to wear
sunscreen and use condoms,” said Dr. Henry, who stayed with the navy for
almost 10 years, meeting her husband there. (They separated five years ago,
after 20 years of marriage, and never had children.)

During a gastrointestinal outbreak onboard, Dr. Henry used basic
epidemiological legwork and a microscope to trace the source of the sickness
to contaminated bottled water they’d taken on board in Tahiti.

One day at her job at a clinic in San Diego, a man burst in with a gun,
demanding to talk to someone. Dr. Henry stepped forward. “I said, ‘I’m
somebody. Let’s talk,’” she recalled. “He burst into tears. He was in pain and
distraught.”

It turned out he was recovering from open-heart surgery and was unsure how he
would pay the medical bills.

It was while working for the World Health Organization tracing Ebola outbreaks
in Uganda that Dr. Henry developed her ideas about how best to respond to
public health emergencies. The keys to an effective quarantine, she came to
understand, were communication and support, like food and medical follow-up,
not punitive measures.

“If you tell people what they need to do and why, and give them the means to
do it, most people will do what you need,” she said.
