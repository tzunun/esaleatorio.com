In this episode, we talk about Virtual Reality's impact on the future of
education. We discuss different modes of learning, such as blended learning
and how VR can add tremendous value there. Futhermore, we look at non-science
examplse where VR can be beneficial, such as history or arts. Phil is an
EdTech entrepreneur and is building Curie, a digital space for teachers and
students to come together and learn. Interestingly, Curie runs not only in VR,
but also has also web/desktop version. For example, while the teacher is
explaining physics topics in VR, students might join via their desktop browser
and still benefit from the lecture.
