A team of researchers from CMU and Technion recently introduced a new system,
Penrose, that can turn complex mathematical notations into various styles of
simple diagrams. The novel system rapidly attracted attention on social media
as a promising visualization tool for effectively communicating complex
mathematical ideas and concepts.

The researchers noted that it is relatively rare to find diagrams in
mathematical writings, which mostly contain formal and technical language.
While high-quality visuals can be useful for effectively conveying
mathematical ideas, the graphic tools required to produce such diagrams are
not always available or user-friendly, and this has limited their usage in
mathematical writing. “There are a ton of great tools for making diagrams, but
we found ourselves always either spending a long time drawing them in a
graphical interface, or meticulously tweaking coordinates in code,” first
author on the Penrose paper and fourth-year CMU PhD student Katherine Ye
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/hypotext/status/1268218084453744699).  
  
Other popular professional typesetting systems such as LaTex convert
mathematical input into a visual representation through algorithmic codifying.
The CMU team similarly designed Penrose to codify the best practices of
mathematical illustrators in a way that is reusable and widely accessible. Ye
says Penrose enables users to create diagrams by simply typing in mathematical
expressions that describe relationships, whereupon “the tool automatically
takes care of laying everything out.”

**But unlike other visualization tools that generate diagrams through direct
manipulation or low-level graphics programming, Penrose offers more than just
illustrations.** With a visual representation that is user-defined in a
constraint-based specification language, Penrose’s capability to separate
abstract mathematical objects and their visual representations can also
provide insights on the inspection and debugging of user-defined data
structures. The mappings from mathematical objects to visual icons make
Penrose a flexible and scalable system.  
  
Although the system enables even novice users to create diagrams by simply
typing mathematical statements in familiar notations, users are expected to
have the necessary knowledge to confirm whether the diagrams correctly
communicate the intended mathematical meaning.

The team named the system after renowned mathematician and physicist Roger
Penrose, whose eponymous Penrose Diagram is a two-dimensional illustration of
the causal relations between different points in spacetime. The team hopes
Penrose can be developed into a broader platform for automatic illustration
that could, for example, automatically illustrate math textbooks or webpages.
They will present the work at the [SIGGRAPH 2020 Conference on Computer
Graphics and Interactive Techniques](https://s2020.siggraph.org/conference/).  
  
The paper _Penrose: From Mathematical Notation to Beautiful Diagrams_ and the
associated code can be found on the project
