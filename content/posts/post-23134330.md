## AggregateError()

AggregateError object takes multiple iterable `Error` instances and wraps them
in a single error.

### Syntax?

    
    
    AggregateError(Array<Error>, "message");

AggregateError Syntax

### How to throw an AggregateError?

    
    
    throw new AggregateError([
        new Error("Required field missing");
        new TypeError("Looking for string by array found");
    ], "All errors in your operation");

Throw an AggregateError

### How to catch an AggregateError?

    
    
    try {
        throw new AggregateError([
            new Error("Required field missing");
            new TypeError("Looking for string by array found");
        ], "All errors in your operation");
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e instanceof AggregateError); //true
        console.log(e.message) //All errors in your operation
        console.log(e.name) //AggregateError
        console.log(e.errors); // [Error: "Required field missing", Error: "Looking for string by array found"]
    }

Catching an AggregateError

### Use cases

  1. During `Promise.all` or `Promise.any` all errors from all async operations can be caught with a single error object. Helps you provide detailed error messages.
  2. If you are an API developer, you can collect all validation errors in an array for a call and report it once, instead of going for a round trip. Most of you may already do it with different ways, AggregateError makes it easy by instantiating one object for each request and lets you collect many errors from ACLs, Authentication, Validation etc.
  3. You don't have to interrupt an execution in the middle by throwing an Error object. You can let it pass and collect all errors in an array and finally deal with the errors if at all required.

### MDN Docs

[AggregateError

The AggregateError object represents an error when several errors need to be
wrapped in a single error.

## Pipeline Operator

Functions with a single parameter, the value of a parameter can be piped into
a function.

### Syntax

    
    
    expression |> function

Syntax for Pipeline Operator

### Example

    
    
    -5 |> Math.abs; // Output: 5

Pipeline Operator Example

### Chaining

Let's take an underscore.js library's example,

    
    
    var stooges = [{name: 'curly', age: 25}, {name: 'moe', age: 21}, {name: 'larry', age: 23}];
    
    stooges |> isArray |> reverse |> last; //Output: {name: 'curly', age: 25}

Chaining with Pipeline Operator

With this new way of chaining methods in JavaScript, it gets rid of the whole
debate about weather method chaining is a good practice or not.

### Unknowns

  1. As it takes only one parameter, do they allow more complex syntax? Like,

    
    
    var names = ["John", "Sam", "Dave", "Bob"];
    var age = [30, 16, 27, 35];
    var getAgeFor = "Sam";
    
    var ageOfSam = age[getAgeFor |> names.indexOf];
    
    
    

Pipeline operator inside array index syntax

2\. Can they play a role in async/await functions? Imagine how clean the code
will look.

3\. Can they also play a role for generator functions?

### MDN Docs

[Pipeline operator

The experimental pipeline operator | (currently at stage 1) pipes the value of
an expression into a function. This allows the creation of chained function
calls in a readable manner. The result is syntactic sugar in which a function
call with a single argument can be written like this:

US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Pipeline_operator)

### Summary

  1. AggregateError helps you collect all Error objects as one object.
  2. Pipeline Operator makes calling functions with single parameter clean and helps you chain methods.
