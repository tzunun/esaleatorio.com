The **Maji Maji Rebellion** ([German](/wiki/German_language "German
language"): _Maji-Maji-Aufstand_ ), sometimes called the **Maji Maji Jihad**
or **Maji Maji War** ([Swahili](/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language"):
_Vita vya Maji Maji_ , _Maji-Maji-Krieg_ ), was an armed rebellion of Islamic
and Animist Africans against German colonial rule in [German East
Africa](/wiki/German_East_Africa "German East Africa") (modern-day
[Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania")). The war was triggered by a German
policy designed to force the indigenous population to grow
[cotton](/wiki/Cotton "Cotton") for export, and it lasted from 1905 to
1907.[4] The war resulted in 250,000–300,000 total dead, mostly civilians from
famine.

After the [Scramble for Africa](/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa "Scramble for
Africa") among the major European powers in the 1880s, Germany had reinforced
its hold on several formal African colonies. These were German East Africa
(now Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and part of Mozambique), German Southwest
Africa (present-day Namibia), Cameroon, and Togoland (today split between
Ghana and Togo). The Germans had a relatively weak hold on German East Africa.
However, they did maintain a system of forts throughout the interior of the
territory and were able to exert some control over it. Since their hold on the
colony was weak, they resorted to using violently repressive tactics to
control the population.[5]

Germany began levying head taxes in 1898, and they relied heavily on forced
labor to build roads and accomplish various other tasks. In 1902, [Carl
Peters](/wiki/Carl_Peters "Carl Peters") ordered villages to grow cotton as a
cash crop (for export). Each village was charged with producing a quota of
cotton. The headmen of the village were left in charge of overseeing the
production, which set them against the rest of the population.

The German policies were very unpopular, as they had serious effects on the
lives of the natives. The social fabric of society was being changed rapidly.
The social roles of men and women were being changed to face the needs of the
communities. Since men were forced away from their homes to work, women were
forced to assume some of the traditional male roles. Also, the fact that men
were away strained the resources of the village and the people's ability to
deal with their environment and remain self-sufficient. There was thus a lot
of animosity against the government at this period. In 1905, a drought
threatened the region. All that, as well as opposition to the government's
agricultural and labor policies, led to open rebellion against the Germans in
July.[6]

The insurgents turned to magic to drive out the German colonizers and used it
as a unifying force in the rebellion. A spirit medium named [Kinjikitile
Ngwale](/wiki/Kinjikitile_Ngwale "Kinjikitile Ngwale"), who practiced [Folk
Islam](/wiki/Folk_Islam "Folk Islam") that incorporated [animist
beliefs](/wiki/Animism "Animism"), claimed to be possessed by a snake spirit
called Hongo.[7] Ngwale began calling himself Bokero and developed a belief
that the people of German East Africa had been called upon to eliminate the
Germans. German anthropologists recorded that he gave his followers war
medicine that would turn German bullets into water. This "war medicine" was in
fact water ( _maji_ in Kiswahili) mixed with [castor oil](/wiki/Castor_oil
"Castor oil") and [millet](/wiki/Millet "Millet") seeds.[7] Empowered with
this new liquid, Bokero's followers began what would become known as the Maji
Maji Rebellion.

The end of the war was followed by a period of [famine](/wiki/Famine
"Famine"), known as the Great Hunger ( _njaa_ ), caused in large part by the
scorched-earth policy advocated by [Gustav Adolf von
Götzen](/wiki/Gustav_Adolf_von_G%C3%B6tzen "Gustav Adolf von Götzen").

## The
uprising[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maji_Maji_Rebellion&action=edit&section=1
"Edit section: The uprising")]

The followers of Bokero's movement were poorly armed with [spears](/wiki/Spear
"Spear") and [arrows](/wiki/Arrow "Arrow"), sometimes poisoned.[8] However,
they were numerous and believed that they could not be harmed because the
Germans' bullets would turn to water.[7] They marched from their villages
wearing [millet](/wiki/Millet "Millet") stalks around their foreheads.
Initially, they attacked small outposts and damaged cotton plants. On 31 July
1905, Matumbi tribesmen marched on Samanga and destroyed the cotton crop as
well as a trading post. Kinjikitile was arrested and hanged for treason.
Before his execution, he declared that he had spread the medicine of the
rebellion throughout the region.[7] On 14 August 1905, Ngindo tribesmen
attacked a small party of missionaries on a safari; all five, including Bishop
Spiss (the [Roman Catholic](/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") Bishop of
[Dar es Salaam](/wiki/Dar_es_Salaam "Dar es Salaam")) were speared to
death.[7]

  
Soon the [Yao](/wiki/Yao_people_\(East_Africa\) "Yao people \(East Africa\)")
tribes started participating and throughout August the rebels moved from the
Matumbi Hills in the southern part of what is now [Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania
"Tanzania") and attacked German garrisons throughout the colony. The attack on
Ifakara, on 16 August, destroyed the small German garrison and opened the way
to the key fortification at [Mahenge](/wiki/Mahenge "Mahenge"). Though the
southern garrison was quite small (there were but 458 European and 588 native
soldiers in the entire area), their fortifications and modern weapons gave
them an advantage. At Mahenge, several thousand Maji Maji warriors (led by
another spirit medium, not Bokero) marched on the German cantonment, which was
defended by Lieutenant [Theodor von Hassel](/wiki/Theodor_von_Hassel "Theodor
von Hassel") with sixty native soldiers, a few hundred loyal tribesmen, and
two [machine guns](/wiki/Machine_gun "Machine gun").[7] The two attacking
tribes disagreed on when to attack and were unable to co-ordinate. The first
attack was met with gunfire from 1000 m; the tribesmen stood firm for about
fifteen minutes, then they broke and retreated. After the first attack, a
second column of 1,200 men advanced from the east. Some of these attackers
were able to get within three paces of the firing line before they were
killed.[7]

The [Qadiriyya Brotherhood](/wiki/Qadiriyya "Qadiriyya") declared a
[Jihad](/wiki/Jihad "Jihad") against the Germans,[9] with [Sufi
Muslims](/wiki/Sufism "Sufism") now playing a major role in the rebellion.

While this was the apex of the uprising, the [Ngoni people](/wiki/Ngoni_people
"Ngoni people") decided to join in the revolt with a force of 5,000. The
Muslim Gwangara Ngoni were relatively recent arrivals in the region,
descendants of a remnant of the Ndwandwe confederation defeated by the Zulus
in 1818 (other Ngoni states were formed in Malawi, Zambia, and north-central
Tanzania). German troops, armed with machine guns, departed from Mahenge to
the Ngoni camp, which they attacked on 21 October. The Ngoni soldiers
retreated, throwing away their bottles of war medicine and crying, "The maji
is a lie!"[10] Upon the outbreak of the fighting, Count [Gustav Adolf von
Götzen](/wiki/Gustav_Adolf_von_G%C3%B6tzen "Gustav Adolf von Götzen"),
governor of German East Africa, had requested reinforcements from the German
government. [Kaiser Wilhelm](/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor "Wilhelm II,
German Emperor") immediately ordered two cruisers with their Marine
complements to the troubled colony.[7] Reinforcements also arrived from as far
away as New Guinea. When 1,000 regular soldiers from Germany arrived in
October, Götzen felt he could go on the offensive and restore order in the
south.[11]

Three columns moved into the rebellious South. They destroyed villages, crops,
and other food sources used by the rebels. They made effective use of their
firepower to break up rebel attacks. A successful ambush of a German column
crossing the [Rufiji River](/wiki/Rufiji_River "Rufiji River") by the Bena
kept the rebellion alive in the southwest, but the Germans were not to be
denied for long. By April 1906, the southwest had been pacified. However,
elsewhere the fighting was bitter. A column under Lt. [Gustav von
Blumenthal](/wiki/Von_Blumenthal "Von Blumenthal") (1879–1913, buried at
[Lindi](/wiki/Lindi "Lindi")) consisting of himself, one other European and 46
Askaris fell under continuous attack as it marched in early May 1906, from
[Songea](/wiki/Songea "Songea") to Mahenge. The Germans decided to concentrate
at [Kitanda](/w/index.php?title=Kitanda&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kitanda \(page
does not exist\)"), where Major Johannes, Lt. von Blumenthal and [Lt. von
Lindeiner-Wildau](/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Lindeiner-Wildau "Friedrich
Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau") eventually gathered. Von Blumenthal was then
sent along the [Luwegu
River](/w/index.php?title=Luwegu_River&action=edit&redlink=1 "Luwegu River
\(page does not exist\)"), partly by boat. The southeast campaign degenerated
into a guerrilla war that brought with it a devastating famine.[7]

The famine following the Maji Maji Rebellion was partly deliberate. Von Götzen
was willing to pardon the common soldiers who gave up their weapons, leaders
and witch doctors. However, he also needed to flush out the remaining rebels
and so chose famine. In 1905, one of the leaders of German troops in the
colony, Captain Wangenheim, wrote to von Götzen, "Only hunger and want can
bring about a final submission. Military actions alone will remain more or
less a drop in the ocean."[12]

Not until August 1907 were the last embers of rebellion extinguished. In its
wake, the rebellion had left 15 Europeans and 389 native soldiers and tens or
even hundreds of thousands[13][14] of insurgents and innocent bystanders dead.
It also broke the spirit of the people to resist, and the colony remained
calm, partly because of a new governor, who brought a more enlightened regime,
until the outbreak of [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I").

## Aftermath and
interpretation[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Maji_Maji_Rebellion&action=edit&section=2
"Edit section: Aftermath and interpretation")]

The [Abushiri revolt](/wiki/Abushiri_revolt "Abushiri revolt") of 1888–1889
and the Wahehe Rebellion of 1891–1898 are viewed by historians as precursors
of the Maji Maji uprising. The suppression of the Maji Maji people changed the
history of southern [Tanzania](/wiki/Tanzania "Tanzania"). Tens, perhaps
hundreds, of thousands of people died or were displaced from their homes. In
the wake of the war, the imperial government instituted administrative
reforms, and by the outbreak of the First World War, Tanganyika could be said
to be among the better-administered European colonies in Africa. The rebellion
became a focal point in the history of the region. Later Tanzanian
[nationalists](/wiki/Nationalist "Nationalist") used it as an example of the
first stirrings of Tanzanian nationalism, a unifying experience that brought
together all the different peoples of Tanzania under one leader, in an attempt
to establish a nation free from foreign domination.

Later historians have challenged that view and claimed that the rebellion
cannot be seen as a unified movement but rather a series of revolts conducted
for a wide range of reasons, including religion. The Muslim Ngoni chiefs were
offered Christian baptism before execution. Many people in the area itself saw
the revolt as one part of a longer series of wars continuing since long before
the arrival of Germans in the region. They cite the alliance of some groups
with the Germans to further their own agendas.
