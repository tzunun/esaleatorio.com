### Discrete Mathematics in the Real World

It's often said that mathematics is useful in solving a very wide variety of
practical problems. {MathILy, MathILy-Er} focus on discrete mathematics,
which, broadly conceived, underpins about half of pure mathematics and of
operations research as well as all of computer science. As time goes on, more
and more mathematics that is done, both in academia and in industry, is
discrete. But what are the actual applications people talk about when they say
discrete mathematics can be applied? What problems are being solved? This
webpage attempts to address those questions. There are short descriptions,
with links to longer explanations, of examples of discrete mathematics as
applied to our everyday lives and as used in important and interesting
research and corporate applications.

##### Everyday applications of discrete mathematics

Encryption and decryption are part of **cryptography** , which is part of
discrete mathematics. For example, [secure internet
shopping](https://ima.org.uk/779/internet-shopping-stopping-the-scammers/)
uses public-key cryptography.

**Area codes** : How do we know when we [need more area
codes](http://www.ajc.com/news/more-404-678-area-codes-given-
atlanta/9SH1szLvrf3e6S7H2aiPZP/) to cover the phone numbers in a region? This
is a basic combinatorics problem.

Designing **password criteria** is a counting problem: Is the space of
passwords chosen large enough that a hacker can't break into accounts just by
trying all the possibilities? How long do passwords need to be in order to
resist such attacks? ([find out here](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm)!)

**Apportionment** : In the U.S., the legislative branch of the government has
a House of Representatives with 435 members. The process of deciding how many
of these members should be allocated to each state is called
[apportionment](http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-apportion1),
and there is a lot of discrete mathematics involved---both in creating and
implementing [various apportionment
methods](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-apportionii1).

**Computer graphics** (such as in video games) use linear algebra in order to
transform (move, scale, change perspective) objects. That's true for both
applications like [game
development](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/lets-
build-a-3d-graphics-engine-linear-transformations--gamedev-7716), and for
[operating systems](http://metalbyexample.com/linear-algebra/).

**Compact discs** store a lot of data, which is encoded using [ a modified
Reed-Solomon
code](https://web.archive.org/web/20180917213045/https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/wdj/_files/documents/reed-
sol.htm) (a binary code, and thus discrete math) to automatically correct
transmission errors.

**Digital image processing** uses discrete mathematics to [merge
images](http://blog.kleinproject.org/?p=588) or apply filters.

**Food Webs** : A food web describes the ways in which a set of species eat
(and don't eat) each other. They can be
[studied](https://proopnarine.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/graphs-and-food-webs/)
[using](https://proopnarine.wordpress.com/2010/02/20/random-graphs-and-food-
webs/) [graph](https://proopnarine.wordpress.com/2010/02/23/food-webs-as-
networks/) [theory](http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12917.full).

##### Research and corporate applications that use discrete mathematics

Determining voting districts, a process known as **redistricting** , is rife
with problems and influenced by politics. Many researchers in various fields
work on methods for fair redistricting, and [some use lots of discrete
math](https://mggg.org/work.html).

Network flows, a part of discrete math, can be used to help **protect
endangered species from the threat of global warming** (see [the abstract for
this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/07-0507.1/full)).

**Robot arms** are a type of
[linkage](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-links1), the
study of which is part of discrete geometry.

Voting theory (see earlier on this page) can be used to decide how to
prioritize among **biodiversity conservation** sites (see [the abstract for
this
paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710002144)).

**Determining how best to add streets to congested areas of cities** [uses
graph theory](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2018-12)
(and in fact an area of graph theory taught in one of the MathILy branch
classes!).

**Matching medical-school graduates to hospital residencies** is solved using
an algorithm that is provably optimal. Here are
[two](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-school-choice)
[articles](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2015-03) that
describe the discrete mathematics involved and what happens when this is
extended to the problem of matching middle-school students to high schools.

**Measuring the evolutionary distance between genomes** can be done using
permutations, as described [here](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-
column/fc-2017-03).

The spread of infectious disease is affected by personal contacts and by
behaviors influenced by information. One **[model of
epidemics](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/network-theory-links-
behavioral-information-flow-with-contained-epidemic-outbreaks)** uses graph
theory by encoding personal contacts and behaviors as layers in a large
network.

**Design of radar and sonar systems** uses graph theory via [Golomb
rulers](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2012-01).
